# User Management Scripts

This repository contains simple scripts for managing users in Linux and Windows environments. It demonstrates:

- Creating users
- Adding users to groups
- Implementing the **Least Privilege** model for assigning permissions

## How to Use

### Linux

1. To create a new user, run `create_user.sh`.
2. To add a user to a group, run `add_user_to_group.sh`.

### Windows

1. To create a new user, run `create_user.ps1`.
2. To add a user to a group, run `add_user_to_group.ps1`.

## Least Privilege Model

The scripts aim to provide minimal permissions by assigning users to specific groups based on their required privileges.
